module Disruptor
  #
  # Implements a lock based wait strategy.
  #
  # Use when CPU resources are more of a concern than throughput and latency.
  #
  # Blocking causes a context switch when the thread sleeps, consider the
  # BusySpinWaitStrategy instead if you expect the wait time to be less than
  # the time it takes perform a context switch.
  #
  # This strategy is preferred if you have more threads than logical cores.
