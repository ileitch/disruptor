module Disruptor
  #
  # This class implements an n-writer ring buffer.
  #
  # A publisher must first claim a slot in the buffer before it can write
  # any data. This is achieved using a pointer to the next available slot
  # which is incremented using CAS. Once the Publisher has written data
  # it commits it (makes it visible to Processors) by setting a cursor
  # pointer.
  #
  # Publishers commit in the same order they claim a slot, this is enforced
  # for you by the buffer. For example, Publisher A has claimed slot 1 and
  # Publisher B slot 2. Publisher A - for whatever reason - may take more
  # time to commit the slot than Publisher B. In this scenario Publisher B
  # will spin trying to set the cursor until A commits.
  #
  # Note that the actual position of data in the ring buffer is never known
  # outside of the buffer. Publishers and Processors communicate with the
  # buffer using a non-looping sequence. The buffer uses the sequence
  # modulo the buffer size as the physical slot.
