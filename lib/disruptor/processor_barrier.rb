module Disruptor
  #
  # This class implements a thread-safe read barrier between the buffer
  # and Processors.
  #
  # Processors ask the barrier for the next sequence they want, the barrier
  # spins waiting for the sequence to become available.
  # This is achieved without CAS as the buffer's cursor is protected by a
  # memory barrier.
  #
  #           <- claimed ->
  # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
  #        ^                 ^
  #        cursor            next
  #
  # In this example sequences 0, 1 and 2 are available for reading by
  # the processors.
